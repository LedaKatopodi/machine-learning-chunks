## ðŸ“— Introduction

Bayesian statistics for machine learning.

## ðŸ”‘ Prerequisites

**R version 4.0.2**; highly possible that the script can run on previous versions of R.

All R packages that are utilized in the frame of these implementations are included in the relevant R scripts/ R Markdown, and are automatically installed -if not already installed- when running the script.

## ðŸ‘Ÿ Walkthrough

### ðŸ§® `MachineLearningChunks.Rmd`

A collection of Machine Learning tasks revolving around Bayesian statistics, learning, and implementations. The code is included in the R Markdown, split by problem; the final report can be found [here](/out/MachineLearningChunks.html).
